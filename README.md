# Crop-Yield-Prediction-Comparison-using-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning-Techniques.

Predicting the crop yield of the 5 most sown crops of the state of Rajasthan, India - Wheat, Rapeseed and Mustard, Barley, Bajra and Jowar. Also using factors of soil type and rainfall to get a more scientific analysis. In this project machine learning and deep learning models have been used and their results have been compared on the basis of R2 score, RMSE values and MAE values. Models used - Random Forest, SVM, Lasso Regression, Gradient Descent and LSTM.
